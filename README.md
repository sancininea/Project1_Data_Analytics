# Project1_Data_Analytics

##This is the first project of the BootCamp

In this project we choose some Datasets from OurWorldInData.org and apply all the knowledges adquired in the BootCamp:

- Data selection
- Data cleaning
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statistics

Our code can take any dataset (with a specific format) and cross it with any other dataset to find if they are correlated and the time that takes to view the effects of that correlation.

Example:

We use the Life Expectancy index for 2017 and cross it with several data including:
- Access to clean water
- Tobacco consumption
- Body Mass Index
- GPD

Then we calculate the coefficients and p_value to see if they are correlated, then we plot the data from the year with the max coefficient and see if the tendency shows a real correlation.

We also include an interesting function that we create and don't use in the final code. Is a customized function that creates a line plot with a secondary axis (doublePlotTest.ipynb). It's a nice code, but don't work for our project.
